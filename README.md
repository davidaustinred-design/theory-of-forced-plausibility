# Theory of Forced Plausibility

This repository contains the working paper and examples for the **Theory of Forced Plausibility**.

The core idea: start with configurations that appear logically or technically impossible, then iteratively adjust constraints, context, and interpretation until the configuration becomes *functionally true* in a real system (hardware, software, or AI reasoning).
